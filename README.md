My skeleton ðŸ’€ for my own future projects. Happy Halloween.

React with Redux where the build steps somehow works together.

- Uses Emotion for CSS-in-JS
- Typescript only performs type checking. This is because Emotion can take advantage of compiler optimizations if compiled using Babel
- Babel transforms Typescript and React code into JS
- ESLint configured to use AirBNB style, although some rules don't always play well with React and Redux
- Redux Toolkit and React Redux used to interface with Redux
- Production build is minified using Terser
- Dev script generates source maps and starts a live-reloaded web server
